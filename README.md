I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following 



## Bootstrap Structure
Easy to understand and easy and fast way to deliver a nice portfolio



## CSS and HTML
Used to markup and style the website in way that is organized and useful.



## JavaScript
You will find Javascrit in some project that I've made and  for more project beyond the portfoli you can find them on my github.
